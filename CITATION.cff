abstract = {To face the climate change, Android developers urge to become green software developers. But how to ensure carbon-efficient mobile apps at large? In this paper, we introduce ecoCode, a SonarQube plugin able to highlight code structures that are smelly from an energy perspective. It is based on a curated list of energy code smells likely to impact negatively the battery lifespan of Android-powered devices. The ecoCode&nbsp; plugin enables analysis of any native Android project written in Java in order to enforce green code. â€” Demo video on https://youtu.be/4XIYGyPEhXQ},
